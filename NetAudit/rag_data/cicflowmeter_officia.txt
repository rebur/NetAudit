CICFlowMeter Official Documentation (2024)

Flow Timeout Policy:
- TCP flows are terminated upon proper connection teardown (FIN packet)
- UDP flows and inactive TCP flows are terminated by a flow timeout
- Default timeout value: 120 seconds (600 seconds configurable)

Known Behavior:
- When a TCP connection is idle for >120 seconds, CICFlowMeter generates a new flow
- Long-lived benign connections (SSH, FTP control channel, IRC) are frequently split
- This creates spurious unidirectional "appendix flows" with incomplete handshake/termination
