RFC 793 - Transmission Control Protocol (September 1981)

3.  FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION

3.2.  Terminology

  connection
     A logical communication path identified by a pair of sockets.

  segment
     A logical unit of data, in particular a TCP segment includes a TCP header and data.

3.4.  Establishing a connection

  The "three-way handshake" is the procedure used to establish a connection.

  NORMAL CASE:
    Step 1: SYN (active open)
    Step 2: SYN, ACK (passive open)
    Step 3: ACK

3.8.  Closing a Connection

  CLOSE is an operation meaning "I have no more data to send."  The notion of closing a full-duplex connection is subject to ambiguous interpretation.

  Both sides must send FIN and receive ACK of that FIN to complete graceful closure.

  A connection is considered closed when both sides have sent and received FIN.

[...Section 3.9 on Reset (RST) flags...]
  An RST is used to refuse an invalid segment or abort a connection.
